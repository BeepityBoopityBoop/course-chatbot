<h1>HORT 2210 — Weeks 3–4 Lecture Notes</h1>
<h2>Plant Anatomy: Roots, Stems, Leaves, Flowers, and Fruit</h2>

<h2>Roots</h2>
<p>Roots serve four primary functions: anchoring the plant, absorbing water and minerals, storing food reserves, and in some species, vegetative propagation. Most horticultural crops have one of two root system types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Taproot system:</strong> A single dominant root that grows vertically downward, with smaller lateral roots. Common in dicots. Examples: carrot, parsnip, dandelion. Taproots are often used for food storage.</li>
  <li><strong>Fibrous root system:</strong> A dense network of similarly sized roots with no dominant central root. Common in monocots. Examples: grasses, onion, corn. Fibrous roots are excellent for preventing soil erosion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The zone of active water and nutrient absorption is the <strong>root hair zone</strong>, just behind the root tip. Root hairs are tiny extensions of epidermal cells that dramatically increase surface area. The very tip of the root is protected by the <strong>root cap</strong>, which produces a slimy mucilage to ease the root's passage through soil.</p>

<h2>Stems</h2>
<p>Stems provide the structural framework of the plant and serve as the conduit for water, nutrients, and sugars between roots and leaves. Key stem structures include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Nodes:</strong> Points on the stem where leaves, buds, or branches attach.</li>
  <li><strong>Internodes:</strong> Sections of stem between two nodes.</li>
  <li><strong>Axillary buds:</strong> Buds located in the axil (angle) between a leaf and the stem, capable of developing into branches or flowers.</li>
  <li><strong>Apical bud (terminal bud):</strong> The growing tip of the main stem; responsible for primary growth (elongation).</li>
</ul>
<p>Stems are classified as <strong>herbaceous</strong> (soft, green, non-woody — e.g., tomato, basil) or <strong>woody</strong> (hardened with lignified tissue — e.g., apple, rose). Modified stems in horticulture include bulbs (onion), corms (gladiolus), tubers (potato), and rhizomes (iris).</p>

<h2>Leaves</h2>
<p>Leaves are the primary sites of photosynthesis. A typical leaf consists of the <strong>blade</strong> (the flat, broad surface), the <strong>petiole</strong> (the stalk connecting blade to stem), and in some species, <strong>stipules</strong> (small leaf-like structures at the petiole base).</p>
<p>Leaf arrangement on the stem is an important identification characteristic:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Alternate:</strong> One leaf per node, alternating sides (e.g., apple, elm).</li>
  <li><strong>Opposite:</strong> Two leaves per node, directly across from each other (e.g., maple, mint).</li>
  <li><strong>Whorled:</strong> Three or more leaves per node arranged in a ring (e.g., bedstraw, some lilies).</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaf margins (edges) are described as entire (smooth), serrated (toothed), lobed, or deeply dissected, and are used in plant identification.</p>

<h2>Flowers</h2>
<p>Flowers are the reproductive structures of angiosperms. A complete flower contains all four whorls:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sepals (calyx):</strong> Outermost whorl; typically green and leaf-like; protect the flower bud.</li>
  <li><strong>Petals (corolla):</strong> Often brightly coloured to attract pollinators.</li>
  <li><strong>Stamens (androecium):</strong> Male reproductive organs, consisting of a filament topped by a pollen-producing anther.</li>
  <li><strong>Pistil (gynoecium):</strong> Female reproductive organ, consisting of the stigma (pollen-receiving surface), style (stalk), and ovary (which contains the ovules).</li>
</ol>
<p>An <strong>incomplete flower</strong> lacks one or more of the four whorls. A <strong>perfect flower</strong> contains both stamens and pistil (e.g., tomato, apple). An <strong>imperfect flower</strong> contains either stamens or pistil but not both (e.g., cucumber, squash — which have separate male and female flowers on the same plant).</p>

<h2>Pollination and Fertilisation</h2>
<p>Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma. It may be achieved by wind (anemophily), insects (entomophily), birds (ornithophily), or artificial means. <strong>Self-pollination</strong> occurs within the same flower or between flowers on the same plant. <strong>Cross-pollination</strong> requires pollen from a different plant and is often necessary for fruit set in crops such as apples and pears.</p>

<h2>Fruit</h2>
<p>In botanical terms, a fruit is the mature ovary of a flower, typically containing seeds. Common fruit types in horticulture:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
  <tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Examples</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Berry</td><td>Fleshy fruit with seeds embedded in pulp</td><td>Tomato, grape, cucumber</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Drupe</td><td>Fleshy fruit with a hard stone (pit) enclosing the seed</td><td>Peach, cherry, plum</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Pome</td><td>Fleshy fruit derived partly from the receptacle</td><td>Apple, pear</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Legume (pod)</td><td>Dry fruit that splits along two seams</td><td>Bean, pea</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Achene</td><td>Small, dry, one-seeded fruit</td><td>Strawberry surface seeds, sunflower</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Note: many culinary "vegetables" are botanically fruits because they develop from the ovary of the flower — for example, tomatoes, peppers, squash, and cucumbers.</p>

<h2>Review Questions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Compare taproot and fibrous root systems and give two horticultural examples of each.</li>
  <li>What is the function of root hairs?</li>
  <li>Distinguish between axillary and apical buds.</li>
  <li>List the four whorls of a complete flower and the function of each.</li>
  <li>Why is cross-pollination important for apple production?</li>
  <li>Is a cucumber a fruit or a vegetable? Explain using botanical definitions.</li>
</ol>
