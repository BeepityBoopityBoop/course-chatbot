<ol>
  <li>Identify and describe the major structures and functions of flowering plants.</li>
  <li>Classify soils by texture and composition and recommend amendments for horticultural use.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate seed germination, cuttings, and division propagation techniques.</li>
  <li>Identify common garden pests and diseases and select appropriate Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies.</li>
  <li>Apply sustainable and environmentally responsible growing practices.</li>
  <li>Plan and maintain a productive planting schedule across seasons.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Late Work Policy</h2>
<p>Lab reports submitted within 24 hours of the deadline receive a 10% deduction. Submissions 24–72 hours late receive a 25% deduction. No lab reports will be accepted more than 72 hours after the deadline without a documented medical or family emergency approved in advance by the instructor.</p>
<p>Quizzes cannot be made up except in cases of documented medical emergencies notified before the quiz date. The final project deadline is firm — no extensions will be granted.</p>

<h2>Greenhouse Lab Policy</h2>
<p>Students must wear closed-toe shoes and gardening gloves during all greenhouse lab sessions. Lab sessions run Thursdays 10:00–11:20 AM in the campus greenhouse (Building C). Attendance at all six lab sessions is mandatory. Missing more than two lab sessions without documented reason will result in a grade of zero for the lab report component.</p>

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>All submitted work must be your own. Collaboration on lab reports is permitted for data collection only — written analysis must be completed independently. Use of AI-generated text without attribution is considered academic dishonesty under NBCC Policy 4.2.1. Students may use AI tools as a learning aid but must declare this in a brief note at the top of any submission.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>Students requiring academic accommodations must submit their Accessibility Services documentation to the instructor within the first two weeks of class. Retroactive accommodations will not be applied to assessments already completed.</p>
