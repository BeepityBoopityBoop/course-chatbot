<h1>HORT 2210 — Weeks 1–2 Lecture Notes</h1>
<h2>Introduction to Horticulture and Plant Classification</h2>

<h2>What Is Horticulture?</h2>
<p>Horticulture is the science and art of growing plants for food, medicine, environmental restoration, and aesthetic purposes. It is distinct from agronomy (which focuses on field crops such as wheat and corn) in that horticulture deals primarily with high-value, intensively managed crops including fruits, vegetables, herbs, ornamental plants, and turf.</p>
<p>The word comes from the Latin <em>hortus</em> (garden) and <em>cultura</em> (cultivation). Modern horticulture is a multi-billion-dollar global industry and encompasses careers in nursery production, landscape design, greenhouse management, urban agriculture, and research.</p>

<h2>Major Branches of Horticulture</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pomology:</strong> The study and cultivation of fruit crops (apples, pears, stone fruits).</li>
  <li><strong>Olericulture:</strong> The production of vegetables for fresh market and processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Floriculture:</strong> The production of cut flowers, potted plants, and floral design.</li>
  <li><strong>Landscape Horticulture:</strong> The design, installation, and maintenance of outdoor and indoor plantings.</li>
  <li><strong>Arboriculture:</strong> The cultivation and management of individual trees and woody plants.</li>
  <li><strong>Postharvest Technology:</strong> The handling, storage, and processing of harvested horticultural products.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Plant Classification</h2>
<p>Plants are classified using a hierarchical taxonomy developed by Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century. The major ranks from broadest to most specific are:</p>
<p><strong>Kingdom → Division → Class → Order → Family → Genus → Species</strong></p>
<p>In horticulture, we most frequently work at the level of genus and species. The scientific name of a plant consists of its genus (capitalised) followed by its species (lower case), both written in italics. For example, the common tomato is <em>Solanum lycopersicum</em>.</p>

<h3>Cultivars and Varieties</h3>
<p>Below the species level, horticulturalists work with <strong>cultivars</strong> (cultivated varieties) — plants selected or bred for specific desirable traits. Cultivar names are written in single quotes after the species name, e.g. <em>Solanum lycopersicum</em> 'Beefsteak'. A <strong>variety</strong>, by contrast, refers to a naturally occurring variation within a species.</p>

<h2>Plant Life Cycles</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Annuals:</strong> Complete their entire life cycle (germination → flowering → seed set → death) within one growing season. Examples: basil, marigold, sunflower.</li>
  <li><strong>Biennials:</strong> Require two growing seasons to complete their life cycle, typically producing vegetative growth in year one and flowering in year two. Examples: carrot, parsley, foxglove.</li>
  <li><strong>Perennials:</strong> Live for three or more years, often dying back to the ground in winter and re-sprouting in spring (herbaceous perennials) or maintaining woody above-ground structure year-round (woody perennials). Examples: hostas, peonies, apple trees.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Monocots vs. Dicots</h2>
<p>Flowering plants (angiosperms) are divided into two major groups based on their seed structure:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
  <tr><th>Feature</th><th>Monocots</th><th>Dicots</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Seed leaves (cotyledons)</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Leaf venation</td><td>Parallel</td><td>Branching (net-like)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Flower parts</td><td>In multiples of 3</td><td>In multiples of 4 or 5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Root system</td><td>Fibrous</td><td>Taproot</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Vascular bundles</td><td>Scattered</td><td>Arranged in a ring</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Examples</td><td>Grasses, lilies, tulips, corn</td><td>Roses, tomatoes, beans, oaks</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Key Terms</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Taxonomy:</strong> The science of classifying organisms.</li>
  <li><strong>Binomial nomenclature:</strong> The two-part Latin naming system (genus + species).</li>
  <li><strong>Cultivar:</strong> A plant variety produced through selective breeding or selection and maintained in cultivation.</li>
  <li><strong>Annual / Biennial / Perennial:</strong> Plant life-cycle classifications.</li>
  <li><strong>Angiosperm:</strong> A flowering plant that produces seeds enclosed within a fruit.</li>
  <li><strong>Gymnosperm:</strong> A plant that produces seeds not enclosed in a fruit (e.g., conifers).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Review Questions</h2>
<ol>

  <li>Distinguish between a monocot and a dicot using three characteristics.</li>
  <li>What is the difference between a biennial and a perennial?</li>
